    Created repo. I have no idea what I'm going to do yet, but I might as well lay some groundwork.

    While I get some boilerplate done, I'm wondering what mechanics fit with the theme of a small world.

    I think I'm more likely to go with the literal small world than the figurative, since I'm not sure I can make an interesting game about meeting people by coincidence in 48 hours.

    I'm thinking maybe some kind of puzzle game based around managing limited space in an enclosed location.

    Got a window up, clearing, and closing properly.
